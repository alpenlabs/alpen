        Test Scenario: Ensure nodes ignore L1 checkpoints with invalid proofs and
                       correctly process subsequent valid checkpoints for the same epoch.

        Test Strategy:
            - Run 2 sequencers with the same credentials but different configurations
              for proof timeout (strict vs. fastBatch).
            - Run 2 prover one for fastBatch and one for strict
            - Run 1 full node with a strict proof policy, requiring real proofs
              and rejecting empty/invalid ones.

        Test Steps:
            - Stop the strict prover, strict sequencer, and full node services.
            - Sequencer 1 (fastBatch) creates epoch 4 with an empty proof and publishes it to L1.
            - Stop sequencer 1.
            - Capture the L1 checkpoint DA envelope data for epoch 4 created by sequencer 1.
            - Stop the fast prover.
            - Start the strict prover, strict sequencer, and full node services.
            - Wait for sequencer 2 (strict) to process the initial epochs (up to 3).
            - Stop the strict prover temporarily.
            - Publish the captured L1 checkpoint DA envelope data (with the invalid proof)
              for epoch 4 to L1 again.
            - The full node and sequencer 2 should ignore the checkpoint with invalid proof,
              not finalize epoch 4 based on it, and wait for a valid checkpoint.
            - Start the strict prover again.
            - Both the full node and sequencer 2 should continue working normally,
              generate a valid proof, and finalize epoch 4 (and subsequently epoch 5)
              with the valid checkpoint.
            - After finalizing epoch 4 with the valid proof, resubmit the previous
              invalid proof data for epoch 4.
            - The full node and sequencer 2 should ignore this resubmission and continue
