/// 1. Ensuring that the block's hash is below the current target, which is a threshold representing
///    a hash with a specified number of leading zeros. This target is directly related to the

/// 2. Verifying that the encoded previous block hash in the current block matches the actual hash
///    of the previous block.
///
/// 3. Checking that the block's timestamp is not lower than the median of the last eleven blocks'
///    timestamps and does not exceed the network time by more than two hours.
///
/// 4. Ensuring that the correct target is encoded in the block. If a retarget event occurred,
///    validating that the new target was accurately derived from the epoch timestamps.
