//! Subprotocol trait definition for ASM.
//!
//! This trait defines the interface every ASM subprotocol implementation must
//! provide. Each subprotocol is responsible for parsing its transactions,
//! updating its internal state, and emitting cross-protocol messages and logs.

/// Trait for defining subprotocol behavior within the ASM framework.
///
/// Subprotocols are modular components that can be plugged into the ASM to handle
/// specific transaction types and maintain their own state within the anchor state.
/// Each subprotocol defines its own transaction processing logic, message handling,
/// and state management.
///
///
/// 1. processes each new L1 block to update its own state and emit outgoing inter-protocol
///    messages, and then
/// 2. receives incoming messages to finalize and serialize its state for inclusion in the global
///    AnchorState.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// struct MySubprotocol;
///
/// impl Subprotocol for MySubprotocol {
///     const ID: SubprotocolId = 42;
///     type State = MyState;
///     type GenesisConfig = MyConfig;
///     type Msg = MyMessage;
///     type AuxInput = MyAuxData;
///
///     fn init(genesis_config: Self::GenesisConfig) -> Result<Self::State, AsmError> {
///        // init logic
///     }
///
///     fn pre_process_txs(state: &Self::State, txs: &[TxInputRef], ...) {
///         // Pre-process transactions
///     }
///
///     fn process_txs(state: &mut Self::State, txs: &[TxInputRef], ...) {
///         // Process transactions
///     }
///
///     fn process_msgs(state: &mut Self::State, msgs: &[Self::Msg]) {
///         // Process messages
///     }
