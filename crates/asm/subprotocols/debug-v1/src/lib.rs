//! Debug Subprotocol
//!
//! This crate implements a debug subprotocol for ASM.
//! It provides testing capabilities by allowing injection of mock data through special
//! L1 transactions.
//!
//! # Purpose
//!
//! The debug subprotocol enables testing of ASM components in isolation:
//!
//! - Test the Bridge subprotocol without running the full Orchestration Layer
//! - Test the Orchestration Layer without running the full bridge infrastructure
//! - Inject arbitrary log messages for testing log processing
//!
//! # Transaction Types
//!
//! The debug subprotocol supports the following transaction types:
//!
//! - **`MOCK_ASM_LOG_TX_TYPE` (1)**: Injects arbitrary log messages into the ASM log output,
//!   simulating logs that would normally originate from the bridge subprotocol. Example: Deposit
//!   events (locking funds in n/n multisig)
//!
//! - **`MOCK_WITHDRAW_INTENT_TX_TYPE` (2)**: Creates withdrawal intents that are sent to the bridge
//!   subprotocol, simulating withdrawals from the Orchestration Layer. Format: `[amount: 8
//!   bytes][descriptor: variable]` where the descriptor is self-describing Bitcoin-BOSD format.
//!   These messages normally originate from the Checkpoint subprotocol through inter-protocol
//!   messaging.
//!
//! # Subprotocol ID
//!
//! The debug subprotocol uses ID 255 (u8::MAX) to avoid conflicts with production
//! subprotocols, which are assigned incremental IDs starting from 0 as specified in the
//! spec documents.
//!
//! # Security
//!
//! This subprotocol is intended for testing only and should never be enabled
//! in non-testing runtime. It's available when ASM is initiated with `DebugAsmSpec`
//! and should not be included in non-testing runtime builds.
