/// EE upgrades allow updating the execution environment, including:
/// - Rollup verifying keys for proof verification
/// - Sequencer public keys for checkpoint authentication
/// - Protocol parameters and consensus rules
///
/// # Implementation Notes
///
/// This handler should:
/// 1. Parse upgrade transaction data
/// 2. Validate upgrade authorization (governance/multisig)
/// 3. Verify new verifying keys and parameters
/// 4. Apply upgrades to state (sequencer key, verifying key, etc.)
/// 5. Emit upgrade logs for monitoring
/// 6. Handle upgrade coordination with other subprotocols
