/// Given a batch execution transitioning from block `M` to block `N`:

///
/// # Overview
///
/// The `TxFilterConfigTransition` tracks the transition of the `TxFilterConfig` ensuring
/// consistency in transaction filtering parameters over time. The transition is identified by its
/// hash of the initial state `pre_config_hash` and `post_config_hash` hash of the update state.
/// Hash is computed on the borsh serialized TxFilterConfig
///
/// # Lifecycle and Dependencies
///
/// - **Initial Derivation**: `TxFilterConfig` is derived from `RollupParams`.
/// - **Epoch Updates**: At the end of each epoch, the `Chainstate` is used to update the
///   `TxFilterConfig`.
/// - **Checkpoint Inclusion**: An epoch only progresses after a valid checkpoint is posted in
///   Bitcoin. The terminal L1 block of epoch N contains the checkpoint for epoch N-1, which
///   includes the `Chainstate` at the end of epoch N-1.
/// - **Usage of Chainstate**:
///   - The new `TxFilterConfig` (based on the updated `Chainstate`) is only usable in blocks
///     following the terminal block that contains the checkpoint.
///   - For the terminal block itself and any blocks before it, the `TxFilterConfig` derived from
///     the chainstate at the end of epoch N-2 must be used.
///   - Consequently, `pre_config_hash` corresponds to the `TxFilterConfig` at the beginning of
///     epoch N-2 (or equivalently, the end of epoch N-2), and `post_config_hash` corresponds to the
///     `TxFilterConfig` at the end of epoch N-1.
///
/// # Notes
///
/// - By capturing both the old and new configuration states, this struct allows verifiers to
///   confirm that the `TxFilterConfig` evolved correctly according to the checkpointed chainstate.
/// - The transition can be checked against the proof to ensure no unauthorized modifications
///   occurred.
