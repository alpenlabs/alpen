//! Types relating to chainstate database.
//!
//! This is in a separate module since it's a complex database due to the large
//! size of structures.
//!
//! The assumption we have here is that full chainstate instances may be large
//! structures, so we want to avoid materializing them in full.  Instead, we
//! maintain a relatively small number of full state snapshots and a set of
//! changesets to them.  This is similar to a write-ahead log, but it's a layer
//! up and we reason about merging logs entries explicitly.
//!
//! The structure of the state now is just the "toplevel" [``Chainstate``]
//! struct.  In the future, we will have a "bulk" state that contains
//! potentially-many ledger entries.
