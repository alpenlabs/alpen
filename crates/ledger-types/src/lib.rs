//! Ledger data types.
//!
//! This crate is NOT about the basic data structures themselves.  This crate
//! focuses on how we access the ledger data structures in state transition
//! execution contexts.
//!
//! We present a trait that represents the various types of structures we
//! interact with in the ledger's state, and expose accessor functions on it.
//! The different impls of these traits are tailored for different contexts.  In
//! some contexts we care about tracing DA generation, in others we may be doing
//! blocking fetches from disk we want to trace for later proof generation.
//!
//! We use the `I` prefix convention which is normally uncommon in Rust to refer
//! to these abstract data structures.  This is because the "ordinary" struct
//! versions of these data structure we use on the wire are the "real" versions
//! we want to think of them as being, but these traits are standins for those.
//! Making up new names for these items would crate too much confusion.
//!
//! As for structure, this design is based around a "toplevel" state that is not
//! ever actually directly accessed.  Below it, there are two parts:
//!
//! * A "global" state that is treated using the DA framework directly.
//! * A "L1 view" state that is only updated in the sealing phase and isn't included in DA.
//! * An "accounts" table, which are selectively loaded.
//!
//! These parts are committed to in the toplevel state, which is updated later
//! when we finish a state transition.
