// I worry that this design is broken down a bit too much and would lead to more
// RPC traffic with the EL node if we do go down and just make this be a wrapper
// to the engine API.  Perhaps we should make this a message oriented
// architecture where we produce a bundle of changes to update our expected idea
// of the EL state and then after applying a bundle of changes we can then go
// and update the external EL state.  That would mean going and making a more
// minimal set of EL calls.  This design would probably be more able to handle
// errors as we'd be able to identify when our perspective on the state is
// inconsistent with the remote state.
