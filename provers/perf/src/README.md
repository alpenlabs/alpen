To generate the report run
```shell
cargo run --release
```

To generate the report along with profiling run 
```shell
cargo run --release -F profiling
```

This will generate the file with .trace extension
Right now this binary only supports the trace generation (profiling info) for the proof generated by `SP1`.

To view the SP1 profile, [Samply](https://github.com/mstange/samply) can be used. 
```bash
samply load <FILENAME>.trace`
```

To install samply (optional) if you already don't have
```bash
cargo install --locked samply
```
